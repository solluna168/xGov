 I have experience working as a mycologist, permaculture certificate holder, DSP 2, CDL driver, wireline operator 3, crane operator, crew leader/pile operator, sea kayak tour guide, alligator trainer/handler, turtle farm caretaker, contracting, backup battery tech for cell towers, wilderness survival  and bartending. My passions are running crews in demanding environments, being mechanically inclined, hardworking, and, of course, mushrooms. Managing my own farm and building my own crew has always been my dream! encountered everything from running massive pillars to battling alligators to wiring explosives. Using Algorithms technology, my background in several work divisions comes together to create these farms.I was a sea kayak tour leader for a while, and we're going to start offering stand-up paddle board classes for mushroom identification.
I've been guiding groups of up to 14 individuals for five years. Attending a wilderness survival college taught me how to live off the earth, so all of my prior experiences are coming together under one roof.

Additional information

Culture of fungi is not very environmentally friendly. The majority of large farms use plastics for growth and never attempt to achieve the scale and sustainability of an eco-friendly farm. The creative reusing of bags and the use of solar and wind power by Solluna Farm will significantly alter the way that mushrooms are grown on a wide scale. The adoption of fungus will begin with educational courses. Since this will be the first application of NFTs in education, people will have a greater appreciation for what these devices are capable of. With practical classes offered around the state and online resources, we will instruct people on how to cultivate their own food and utilize technology responsibly in the Algorand Ecosystem.
Our two major goals will be to expand the algorand blockchain and fungi. For ongoing research, the Oregon Solluna Farm will cultivate fungus with legal therapeutic properties. I currently work as a DSP for persons who have mental health issues; this product line will be put to the test in a variety of ways to demonstrate how fungi may actually benefit those in need. I used to manage an Algorand ecosystem free NFT poker tournament. We had fifteen of the best NFT projects from Algoland on board; this time, we'll also be giving out courses, cross-chain games, mushroom rewards, and algorand NFTs. Our hearts and souls, plus a little more, are going into this project since working with mushrooms, which has the potential to significantly improve mental health and other health issues, is one of my passions. 
This company offers in-person workshops, mushroom foraging expeditions, and a gentle introduction to cryptocurrency and mushroom cultivation.
